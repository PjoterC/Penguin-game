# Penguin-game

A game that was a group project for my first semester of Computer Science at Warsaw University of technology

 
  The objective is to move the pawns (Penguins) on the rectangular board of ice floes, in order to collect points (fish).
  The fish floes are displayed on the board as numbers 1, 2, 3 (indicating the amount of fish on the ice floe).
  The penguins are displayed as capital letters, each player has their assigned penguins.
  When penguin leaves the ice floe, it will sink, leaving behind a water tile (0).
  Players can move 1 tile in 4 directions.
  Movement that ends on a water tile, other penguin or outside of the board is prohibited.
  The game ends when no player can make a move.

To run, open the compiled file using command line - it will display the possible input parameters that determine which phase should the game start at.
