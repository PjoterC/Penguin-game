# Penguin-game

A game that was a group project for my first semester of Computer Science at Warsaw University of technology

The game is written in C, no GUI, display on terminal. The player's aim is to move their pawns (penguins) and collect points (fish on ice floes), while avoiding empty spots (water).

To run, open the compiled file using command line - it will display the possible input parameters that determine which phase should the game start at.
